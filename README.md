Project 2 - Steganography, hiding messages in different types of media.

Team Name: Anonymous
Team Members: Luigi D'Antonio, YoonJin Lee, Toutoua Vang

Program requires an image renamed to secret.bmp.
When the program is executed the user will be prompted for a message and password which are hidden from view.
The program will encode the message in the image and create a new image named enc_secret.bmp.

After correctly reentering the password the message will be decoded back and displayed on the screen.
The program runs well as it is asked to.
